## Lee Lab Neurobiology of Taste: Taste experience of laboratory mice

### Background

Hello!

My name is Junhua Tan and welcome to my project portfolio for research! I am an undergraduate at Northwestern University where I majored in Neuroscience with an emphasis on the biological field. I also minored in Computer Science and Data Science, which started with an initial interest in programming and now have turned into my career passion. In my undergraduate years, I work as a research assistant at the Lee Lab (Neurobiology of Taste System) where I spent my time performing mice behavioral experiments and exploring the taste experience of üê≠!

I designed and performed behavioral studies on mice and conducted analysis on the different metrics for evaluating taste experience of various gene-knock-out mice. And as the project continued in this summer during the pandemic, my main responsibility becomes doing analysis on my past data and building predictive models to predict taste experience. I have successfully built a convolutional neural network using Python and achieved an accuracy of over 96% for predicting taste experience based on mice‚Äôs facial expression.

Here is a sample model built from published data for [Dolensek, et al.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6486/89) where the authors conducted facial expression analysis on emotions in mice, downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3618395#.XsGdaBNKjxQ).
